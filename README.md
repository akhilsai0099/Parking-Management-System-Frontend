# Parking Management System - Frontend

## Project Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the frontend GitHub repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhilsai0099/Parking-Management-System-Frontend.git
cd Parking-Management-System-Frontend
```

### Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **For Windows:**

  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **For macOS/Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 3: Install Required Packages

Install all required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Streamlit Application

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory** (if not already there):

   ```bash
   cd Parking-Management-System-Frontend
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit application:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will start the Streamlit frontend application and open it in your default web browser.

### Step 5: Testing the Frontend Application

1. **Run Streamlit component tests:**

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

Now, your Parking Management System frontend is set up and ready to run!
